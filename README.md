## Introduction

Dr Ignaz Semmelweis was a Hungarian physician born in 1818 who worked in the Vienna General Hospital. In the past people thought of illness as caused by "bad air" or evil spirits. But in the 1800s Doctors started looking more at anatomy, doing autopsies and started making arguments based on data. Dr Semmelweis suspected that something was going wrong with the procedures at Vienna General Hospital. Semmelweis wanted to figure out why so many women in maternity wards were dying from childbed fever (i.e., [puerperal fever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_infections)).

## The Data Source

Dr Semmelweis published his research in 1861. I found the scanned pages of the [full text with the original tables in German](http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/book/show/semmelweis_kindbettfieber_1861), but an excellent [English translation can be found here](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/the%20etiology,%20concept%20and%20prophylaxis%20of%20childbed%20fever.pdf).
